## 📘 System Description:
The Cloud-Based OJT Monitoring and Journal System is a web-based platform designed to streamline and digitalize the entire On-the-Job Training (OJT) process for students and OJT coordinators. This system serves as a centralized hub where students can apply for OJT placements, maintain their digital journal entries in a social-media style interface, and submit their Daily Time Record (DTR) entries—eliminating the need for manual encoding and paperwork.

## 🏢 OJT Application Process:
Students can browse a list of available and accredited Host Training Establishments (HTEs) within the system. Each student can:

Select an HTE from the list provided by the OJT office.

Submit an online application form with personal details, preferred schedule, and supporting documents.

Track application status (e.g., pending, approved, declined).

Once approved, the student is notified and can begin encoding their DTR and submitting journals.

Coordinators can review and approve/reject applications, assign students to HTEs, and manage placement records efficiently through the system.

## 🧩 Key Features:
OJT Application System with approval tracking for HTE placements

Digital Journal Submission using a Facebook-style interface (no copy-pasting)

Daily Time Record (DTR) Management with grading and verification tools

Built-in Chat System between students and coordinators for quick communication

Coordinator Dashboard for managing student progress, checking entries, and exporting reports

Cloud-Based Access for both students and staff—anytime, anywhere, on any device

## 🎯 Purpose:
To provide a seamless, paperless, and efficient OJT experience by integrating key management functions into a single, user-friendly platform. This improves the documentation, communication, and overall coordination between students and the OJT office, while ensuring proper monitoring of performance and compliance.
